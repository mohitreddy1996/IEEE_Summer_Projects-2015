question 1:
ctrl+u or inspect elements for the web page we get the HTML code of the webpage. there we get the password in comments
<!-- ... -->

question 2:
In the Question its mentioned the "he neglected to upload the password" 
So blank password would be the answer

queston 3:
Again we see the source file (HTML coded)
For the block referring to the password and submit section,when clicked on submit it should lead to password.php(it is given in the action which is hidden from the webpage)
so we replace index.php with password.php
submit and we get the password
