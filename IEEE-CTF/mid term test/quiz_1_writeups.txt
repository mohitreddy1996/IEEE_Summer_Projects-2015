Quiz 1 Write ups

Crypto Q1 :

Surprise! The technique you'll need for solving this one has not been covered in our sessions. By now, you should be able to look at the description of a basic cipher and be able to implement it, whether it's encryption or decryption.

Cipher-text: KZGT
Key: BBBBBCBCBBBABECD
Hint: You might have to deal with something related to "a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain".

Find out the corresponding plain-text!



Ans: BLUE


Explanation :

a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain : refers to a HILL
which means its a HILL CIPHER

Sample text written in form of a vector/matrix * key = cipher text

sample text = (cipher)*(key)^-1 mod 26

we represent A=0,B=1,C=2...Z=25.

we will get the Sample text = BLUE





REVERSE ENGINEERING Q2 :

we open the given bin file using radare2 .
hit
aa - analyse
V- visual 
p
then we can see a list of functions
Go to sym.main()
we can see that -> mov edi,0xa
so the value 10 is taken.
then the function sym.func is called
then in the function sym.func
we can see -> sub eax,1
so the value gets reduced by 1.
so by the jumps statements and recursive calls
the value so formed is 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2 = 10!

so if the quotient when 10! is divided by input is 86400 the output gives SUCCESS!!
